# Project 2: Automatic Headlight Control System
## Team members: Nguyen Hieu Kien, Ayanat Zhumagaliyeva
### Project description:
This project is a safety system designed for student driver cars and is controlled by a small computer. To follow state safety laws, it ensures a supervisor is present by checking that both front seats are filled and both seatbelts are buckled before the car can start. If someone tries to start the engine without meeting these safety rules, an alarm sounds and the screen explains exactly what is missing. Once the car is running, the system can automatically control the headlights using a light sensor. The lights turn on when it gets dark and off when it gets bright, using short delays to keep them from flickering.

### testing result summary:

| Specification | Process | Result |
|---|---|---|
| When the driver is seated, the system prints a welcome message exactly once. | _2 buttons: driver_seat, pass_seat_ <br> 1. When the button is pressed <br> 2. When it is pressed along with another button <br> 3. When it is pressed twice | All tests passed <br> 1. The screen shows the message <br> 2. The screen shows the message <br> 3. The screen shows the message on the first press and nothing on the second |
| Notifies the user it is safe to start (green LED) once all seats are occupied and everyone is buckled. Otherwise, no LED turns on. | _2 buttons: driver_seat, pass_seat; 2 switches: driver_belt, pass_belt_ <br> 1. All buttons/switches engaged <br> 2. All but one (pass_seat) engaged <br> 3. No buttons engaged | All tests passed <br> 1. The green LED turns on <br> 2. Nothing happens <br> 3. Nothing happens |
| The car starts (red LED) once the green LED is on and the ignition button is pressed. Otherwise, an alarm sounds and displays the reason. | _1 button: Ignite_ <br> 1. Green LED is on and button is pressed <br> 2. Green LED is off and button is pressed <br> 3. Green LED is off, button is pressed, then Green LED is turned on and Ignite is pressed | All tests passed <br> 1. The red LED turns on <br> 2. The alarm goes off and displays the missing requirements <br> 3. Same as (2), but once the green LED is on, the red LED lights up |
| When the red LED is on, headlights follow the mode: "on" (headlights on) or "off" (headlights off). Else, they remain off. | _1 potentiometer (switch between "on" and "off")_ <br> 1. Rotating counter-clockwise to "on" <br> 2. Rotating clockwise to "off" <br> 3. Red LED is off and system is set to "on" | All tests passed <br> 1. Both headlights turn on <br> 2. Both headlights turn off <br> 3. Nothing happens |
| When the red LED is on and mode is "auto," the system uses a light sensor to toggle headlights. | _1 photoresistor_ <br> 1. Flashlight pointed at the sensor <br> 2. System placed in a dark environment (under table) | All tests passed <br> 1. The headlights do not turn on <br> 2. The headlights turn on |
| In "auto" mode, the system responds to light changes. Significant changes trigger a 1s delay (turning on) or 2s delay (turning off). Minor changes keep the previous state. | 1. The system is in a dark room and then a flashlight shines above the system  <br> 2. Flashlight that was on and pointed towards the system is turned off <br> 3. The flashlight shines right above the system but it is then moved away still pointing towards the system | All tests passed <br> 1. The headlights that was initially on was off after 1 second <br> 2. The headlight was off initially but after 2 seconds, both headlights turn on <br> 3. Both LEDs remains off |
