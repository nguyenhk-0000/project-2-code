# Project 2: Automatic Headlight Control System
## Team members: Nguyen Hieu Kien, Ayanat Zhumagaliyeva
### Project description:
This project is a safety system designed for student driver cars and is controlled by a small computer. To follow state safety laws, it ensures a supervisor is present by checking that both front seats are filled and both seatbelts are buckled before the car can start. If someone tries to start the engine without meeting these safety rules, an alarm sounds and the screen explains exactly what is missing. Once the car is running, the system can automatically control the headlights using a light sensor. The lights turn on when it gets dark and off when it gets bright, using short delays to keep them from flickering.

### testing result summary:

| Specification | Process | Result |
|---|---|---|
| When the driver is seated, the system will print out a welcome message exactly once | 2 buttons: drive_seat, pass_seat <br> 1. when the button is pressed <br> 2. When it is pressed along with another button <br> 3.When it is pressed twice | All tesss passed <br> 1. The screen shows the message <br> 2. The screen shows the message <br> 3. the screen shows the message on the first press and nothing on the second |
|letting the user know that it is safe to start the engine (i.e., light the green LED) once all seats are occupied and eveyone is buckled .  Otherwise no LED will turn on. | 2 buttons: drive_seat, pass_seat. 2 switches: drive_belt, pass_belt <br> 1. All buttons pressed <br> 2. All but one button (pass_seat) pressed <br> 3. No buttons pressed  | All tests passed <br> 1. The green LED turns on <br> 2. Nothing happened <br> 3.Nothing happened  |
| The car will start (i.e., light the red LED) once the green LED is on and the ignition button is pressed. Otherwise it will sound an alarm and tell the user why it went off, then the user could restart again | 1 button: Ignite <br> 1.When the green LED is on and the button is pressed <br> 2. The green LED is not on and the button is pressed <br> 3. The green LED is not on and the button is pressed, then the user turns on the green LED and then press ignite |All tests passed <br> 1. The red LED turns on <br> 2. the alarm go off and then it showed what element is missing for the car to start <br> 3. same thing happened as (2), but once the green LED is on, when the button is pressed, the red LED lights up   |
|Only when the red LED is on, if the system's mode is set to "on" the two headlights will turn on, if it is set to "off" they will be off. Else they will not turn on  | 1 potentiometer is used to go between on and off <br> 1. Rotating the potentiometer in counter-clockwise direction as far as possible (setting it to "on") <br> 2. Rotating it to the opposite direction (setting it to "off") <br> 3. The red LED is not on and the system is set to "on" | All test passed <br> 1. Both headlights turn on <br> 2. Both headlights turn off <br> 3. Nothing happens |
|Once the red LED is on, if the mode is "auto", then the system will depend on the input of the light sensor to decide whether to turn on the headlights or not.  | 1 photo resistor <br> 1. A flashlight is pointed towards the light sensor <br> 2. the system is underneath the table | All tests passed <br> 1. The headlights does not turn on <br> 2. the headlights turns on |
|If the mode is "auto", and the brightness of the environment has been changed ("dark" to "bright" or conversely), then the system will also change accordingly. If the change in brightness of the environment is not too significant (i.e. is not dark enough to be catagorized as dark or bright enough to be called bright), the headlights will keep their previous state . There will be a 1 second delay before the headlights turn on and a 2 seconds delay once it turns off | 1. The system is in a dark room and then a flashlight shines above the system <br> 2. The flashlight shining above the system is turn on <br> 3. The flashlight shines right above the system but it is then moved away still pointing towards the system |All tests passed <br> 1. After 1 second, both headlights turn on <br> 2. After 2 seconds, both headlights turn off. 3. The two LED remain off |
